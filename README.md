## Install
```bash
xpip install -U xontrib-sh
echo 'xontrib load sh' >> ~/.xonshrc
# Reload xonsh
```

## Usage

Start the line with an exclamation point — `!` — then paste the sh-compatible commands 
after it and run. The commands syntax will be tested in installed shells 
and the commands will be run in the first matching shell. By default list of shells contains bash and sh. 

The commands will be executed in the environment that will be inherited from current
but if the commands modify the environment there will no changes in source xonsh environment.

To set the list of shells use environment variable before loading the xontrib:
```python
$XONTRIB_SH_SHELLS = ['bash', 'sh']  # default
xontrib load sh
```

## Use cases

### The main use case

The main use case of `xontrib-sh` is when you copy and paste the sh-commands from some article or instruction 
and this commands are environment agnostic and you want to run it without rewriting it on xonsh or run sh-shell. 

For example you've found [xxh local](https://github.com/xxh/xxh#using-xxh-inplace-without-ssh-connection) snippet:
```bash
XH=~/.xxh \
 && XD=https://github.com/xxh/xxh-portable/raw/master/result/xxh-portable-musl-alpine-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz \
 && mkdir -p $XH && cd $XH \
 && ( [[ -x $(command -v curl) ]] && curl -L $XD || wget -O- $XD ) | tar zxf - xxh \
 && echo 'Usage: ./xxh local [+s xonsh/zsh/fish/osquery/bash]'
```

It's bash and it's environment agnostic and you hesitate how xonsh will execute this. Just start with `!` and 
paste this commands. As result you've installed `xxh local` and stayed in xonsh.

### One line: brace expansion
```bash
! echo 01.{05..10}
``` 
```
bash:
01.05 01.06 01.07 01.08 01.09 01.10
```

### Many lines: for loop
```bash
! for i in 1 2 3
do
   echo $i
done
```
```
bash:
1
2
3
```

### Use environment variables to pass values from xonsh to sh
```python
$ENV = 'hello'
! echo $ENV!
```
```
bash:
hello!
```

## Known issues

In case of usage many different shells detection of the shell works perfect when the commands contain shell-specific syntax.
But if you run the short command that could be valid in all shells the first matched shell will be chosen but it's could be wrong. 
 
For example you have bash and fish in the list of shells. The short fish command may be determined as bash command.
As result the command will be failed:
```python
$XONTRIB_SH_SHELLS = ['bash', 'fish']
xontrib load sh
# Run fish command:
! set -U EDITOR vim
# bash: line 0: set: -U: invalid option
```

Use shells list carefully! If you have an idea how to improve the shell detection pull requests are welcome!
